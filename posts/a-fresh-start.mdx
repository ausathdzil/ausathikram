summary: Reflection and welcoming a new beginning.

I initially wanted this blog to be a monthly occurence, but college kept me busy and so I haven't been writing anything lately, not even a draft. I will take this oppurtunity to reflect on what I've posted in the past and share it here.

In mid 2024, I started going around and exploring personal blogs made by developers, this inspires me to also make one. I started reading documentations and make a tutorial based on them, an example of this is my post about [Server-side Form Validation](/blog/form-validation).

This helps me to generate ideas quickly on what to write. But then I encountered a bigger problem than I initially thought because my lack of expertise in writing.

## Language

I don't speak English natively, this lead me to write my posts with assistance from Artificial Intelligence (AI) to help my grammar and writing style. I wrote all my posts in markdown format using VSCode and the inline code completion with Copilot really helps a lot.

I've come to a realization that writing posts using AI assistance doesn't feel genuine. I feel like writing posts only for the sake of writing them, not to fulfill my orginal purpose of writing them, that is to help me expand my knowledge and share it.

I won't be using AI for writing things anymore. Even though I know my English isn't good, I should embrace that imperfection. I believe this would help me get better at writing more naturally. I think I can still get across my message somehow, I know my English although not good, it isn't that bad either.

Mistakes will be made, but that is what feedback, criticism, and self-reflection is for.

## Artifical Intelligence

In 2025, AI have become so good. But are they really? I think they're really good at _almost_ everything, but they shouldn't be used for everything. Writing is one of them and I'm making my experience as an example.

I still use AI to help me code, I think it's one of their best use case. But writing is different. I guess I could say that they can be a form of art, I mean poems exists.

Anything that relates to art have a soul. When there's AI in the equation, that soul is gone. No matter how good they have become generating it, I think people that acknowledge arts can still see the difference.

## Future

I will still be writing and do my best to make this monthly, or at least once in two or three months, we'll see.
