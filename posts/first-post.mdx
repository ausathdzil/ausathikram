## Hello World

This is my first blog post, let me introduce myself. My name is **Ausath Abdi Dzil Ikram** and I am a **web developer**. I love to write code and learn new things. I am excited to share my knowledge with you all. I hope you enjoy more of my blog posts in the future.

## Why I Started This Blog

I started this blog as part of my learning journey. Writing in markdowns is fun and easy. I can write my thoughts and ideas in a simple way. I can also share my knowledge with others. But the most important thing is that I can improve my writing skills and learn new things by researching and writing about them.

## What to Expect

I will mostly be writing about **web development**, but also other topics if it interests me. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to [email me](mailto:mail@ausathikram.com). I am always open to feedback and suggestions.
