## The Adventure of the Lost Key

Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a curious cat named **Whiskers**.

## The Discovery

One sunny morning, Whiskers found a mysterious box. On the box, there was a note:

> To open, you must solve the riddle and find the key.

### The Riddle

The note read:

```
I have keys but open no locks,
I have space but no room,
You can enter, but not go outside.
What am I?
```

Whiskers thought for a moment and exclaimed, “A keyboard!”

## The Search

Whiskers decided to search for the key. Along the way, Whiskers met:

- A wise old owl
- A playful squirrel
- A helpful mouse

Each friend gave Whiskers a clue.

### Clues

1. The owl said, “Look where you rest.”
2. The squirrel said, “Check under the tallest tree.”
3. The mouse said, “Don't forget to look up!”

## The Solution

After searching high and low, Whiskers found the key hanging from a branch.

With the key in paw, Whiskers opened the box and found a treasure: a shiny new collar and a note that said:

> Curiosity and friendship are the greatest treasures of all.
