Last week, I won a **hackathon** for the first time ðŸ¥³. Our team achieved 1st place at **Hackvidia**, the official hackathon competition in [Arkavidia 9.0](https://www.instagram.com/arkavidia), one of the biggest IT events and competitions in Bandung held by [HIMF ITB](https://www.instagram.com/hmif_itb/).

[Valtrizt](https://valtrizt.tech) lead our team and developed the back-end. He also, with [Ramadhika](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramadhika-darmaputra-2b03ab261/), built our mobile app. We also couldn't have done this without [Kayla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaylaalisharania/), who did the majority of our research and gave an amazing pitch, and [Aydie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aydierahma/) who painstakingly designs all of our apps. My part in this hackathon is building the web app for our platform. 

We give our best effort in this competition and the result was really satisfying.

## Silatik

We build a platform for JUMANTIK cadres to help with larvae spot reports and prevent dengue cases in Indonesia. There are three main applications: mobile, API and web.

My friends did a great job developing the back-end and mobile, which was honestly why our team won. The technology they implemented was really impressive.

Our focus was to build a mobile application to help cadres, who are working on the field, report larvae spots in urban villages (or *kelurahan* in Indonesia). Most of the areas in Indonesia are rural and don't have good internet connectivity, so they implement a [local-first architecture](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/local-first/).

My task was to build a dashboard for stakeholders (head of urban villages) to monitor reported cases, give insights from AI, and manage cadres.

We did all of this in **24 hours**!

I honestly couldn't believe it myself, but we gave our best effort we've ever given in any competition we've competed in so far.

## Approach

Building three apps in a day isn't an easy feat. So we did our R&D extensively.

The tech stack used in our applications are chosen carefully so we could test out what is viable to develop in such a short time.

We decided that we should make a seperate back-end so that our mobile and web app can use a single source of truth for all of the data, including AI insights.

This decision led our team to success. Building three apps in parallel gave us a significant advantage and allowed us to maximize our strengths (back-end, mobile, and web).

Here is our system architecture:

## Final Thoughts

Hackathons in Indonesia aren't just about building apps, we also need to consider the value they bring and their business aspects.

As with every project I've made in the past, whether its for a competition or just a hobby, I learned a lot in the process.
