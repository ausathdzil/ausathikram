# Ausath Ikram
 
I'm a Frontend Developer and I like to build websites. You can find my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/ausathdzilikram) and connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ausathdzil/).

Sometimes I write about my experiences and thoughts on things that interest me, mostly about web development.
