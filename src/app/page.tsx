          hi ðŸ‘‹ my name is ausath abdi dzil ikram. i&apos;m an undergraduate
          student majoring in information systems.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          i&apos;m interested in web development and are currently learning to
          build websites mainly with the react ecosystem. i frequently use
          next.js as my go to react framework. when working with a database for
          my projects, i usually go for serverless databases like vercel
          postgres and neondb so i can focus on building the app.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          while not really focusing on the back-end, i&apos;ve experienced
          building simple back-end services with node.js and express.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          outside programming, i&apos;ve also experienced designing mobile and
          web apps with figma. as of doing things on my free time, i enjoy
          listening to music, watching movies, and playing games.
