            hi ðŸ‘‹ my name is ausath abdi dzil ikram. i&apos;m an undergraduate
            computer science student majoring in information systems.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            i&apos;m interested in web development and are currently learning to
            build websites mainly with the react ecosystem. i frequently use
            next.js as my go to react framework. when working with a database
            for my projects, i usually go for serverless so i can focus on
            building the app.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            while not really focusing on the back-end, i&apos;ve experienced
            building simple back-end services with node.js.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            outside programming, i&apos;ve also experienced designing mobile and
            web apps with figma. as of doing things on my free time, i enjoy
            listening to music, watching movies, and playing games.
