## why i started this blog

i started this blog as part of my learning journey. writing in markdowns is fun and easy. i can write my thoughts and ideas in a simple way. i can also share my knowledge with others. but the most important thing is that i can improve my writing skills and learn new things by researching and writing about them.

## what to expect

i will mostly be writing about **web development**, but also other topics if it interests me. if you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to [contact me](/contact). i am always open to feedback and suggestions.
