summary: preserving form state after submission in next.js using event handlers and react's startTransition.
---

on my last post, we learned how to [validate forms](/blog/posts/form-validation) using **useActionState**. one problem that arises when submitting a form directly with the action attribute is that the form will be reset after submission.

sometimes we don't want that to happen. for example, say the user submits a form with an error, but not all fields are filled incorrectly. we want to keep the user's input so they don't have to retype everything, even the correct fields.

## event handler

to preserve the form state, we need to use an event handler to call the action, we do this to utilize the **event.Preventdefault()** method to prevent the form from submitting and resetting the form.

```tsx
'use client';

import { createTodo, State } from '@/app/test/action';
import { useActionState } from 'react';

export default function Form2() {
  const initialState: State = {
    success: false,
    message: null,
    errors: {
      title: [],
      body: [],
    },
  };
  const [state, formAction, pending] = useActionState(createTodo, initialState);

  function handleSubmit(event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {
    event.preventDefault();
    formAction(new FormData(event.currentTarget));
  }

  return (
    <form className="space-y-2" onSubmit={handleSubmit} />
      <input name="title" type="text" />
      {state.errors?.title && <p>{state.errors.title.join(', ')}</p>}

      <input name="body" type="text" disabled={pending} />
      {state.errors?.body && <p>{state.errors.body.join(', ')}</p>}

      <button type="submit" disabled={pending}>
        {pending ? 'Submitting...' : 'Submit'}
      </button>
      {state.message && <p>{state.message}</p>}
    </form>
  );
}
```

that's... basically it! now the form will not reset after submission.

bonus: it's a good practice to wrap the **formAction** call with [startTransition](ttps://react.dev/reference/react/startTransition). this tells react that the update is non-urgent.

## startTransition

from the official [react docs](https://react.dev/reference/react/startTransition#marking-a-state-update-as-a-non-blocking-transition): "Transitions let you keep the user interface updates responsive even on slow devices.

With a Transition, your UI stays responsive in the middle of a re-render. For example, if the user clicks a tab but then change their mind and click another tab, they can do that without waiting for the first re-render to finish."

**startTransition** is particularly useful in larger applications or when dealing with slower network conditions. this will lead to smoother user experience.

let's see how we can use it:

```tsx
'use client';

import { startTransition } from 'react';
//...

export default function Form() {
  //...

  function handleSubmit(event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {
    event.preventDefault();
    startTransition(() => {
      formAction(new FormData(event.currentTarget));
    });
  }

  //...
}
```

without **startTransition**, if the network is slow, react might try to update the UI based on the pending state of **formAction** before it completes, potentially causing visual inconsistencies.

by wrapping the **formAction** call with **startTransition**, we tell react to wait for the action to complete before updating the UI, leading to a smoother user experience.

there's other solution to this, but i find this one to be the most straightforward.

hope this helps! let me know if you have any questions.
