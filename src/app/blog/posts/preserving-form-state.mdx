summary: Preserving form state after submission in Next.js using React's startTransition.
---

On my last post, we learned how to [validate forms](/blog/form-validation) using **useActionState**. One problem that arises when submitting a form directly with the action attribute is that the form will reset after submission.

Sometimes we don't want that to happen. For example, say the user submits a form with an error, but not all fields are filled incorrectly, we want to keep the user's input so they don't have to retype everything, even the correct fields.

## Event handler

To preserve the form state, we need to use an event handler to call the action, we do this to utilize the `event.preventDefault()` method to prevent the form from submitting and resetting the form.

```tsx
'use client';

import { createTodo, State } from '@/lib/actions';
import { useActionState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const initialState: State = {
    success: false,
    message: null,
    errors: {},
  };
  const [state, formAction, pending] = useActionState(createTodo, initialState);

  function handleSubmit(event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {
    event.preventDefault();
    formAction(new FormData(event.currentTarget));
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input name="title" type="text" />
      {state.errors?.title && <p>{state.errors.title.join(', ')}</p>}

      <input name="body" type="text" disabled={pending} />
      {state.errors?.body && <p>{state.errors.body.join(', ')}</p>}

      <button type="submit" disabled={pending}>
        {pending ? 'Submitting...' : 'Submit'}
      </button>
      {state.message && <p>{state.message}</p>}
    </form>
  );
}
```

That's... basically it! now the form will not reset after submission.

Bonus: it's a good practice to wrap the **formAction** call with [startTransition](ttps://react.dev/reference/react/startTransition). This tells react that the update is non-urgent.

## startTransition

From the official [React docs](https://react.dev/reference/react/startTransition#marking-a-state-update-as-a-non-blocking-transition):

"Transitions let you keep the user interface updates responsive even on slow devices. With a Transition, your UI stays responsive in the middle of a re-render.

For example, if the user clicks a tab but then change their mind and click another tab, they can do that without waiting for the first re-render to finish."

**startTransition** is particularly useful in larger applications or when dealing with slower network conditions. This will lead to smoother user experience.

Let's see how we can use it:

```tsx
'use client';

import { startTransition } from 'react';
//...

export default function Form() {
  //...

  function handleSubmit(event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {
    event.preventDefault();
    startTransition(() => {
      formAction(new FormData(event.currentTarget));
    });
  }

  //...
}
```

Without **startTransition**, if the network is slow, React might try to update the UI based on the pending state of **formAction** before it completes, potentially causing visual inconsistencies.

By wrapping the **formAction** call with **startTransition**, we tell React to wait for the action to complete before updating the UI, leading to a smoother user experience.

There's other solution to this, but I find this one to be the most straightforward.

Hope this helps!
